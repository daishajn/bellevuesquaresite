        <p>
          This theme is central to the project because Bellevue Square grew out of postwar technological and economic
          change. New bridges, highways, and rising car ownership allowed people to live on the Eastside while working and
          shopping across the region. My website explores WXT through the interactive timeline and before/after slider,

          Bellevue’s physical geography and environmental reshaping are key to understanding its transformation. Early maps
          and photographs show open fields and berry farms, many cultivated by Japanese American families before World War II
          (Snoqualmie Valley Historical Society). On the site, map overlays and images compare the 1930s–1940s landscape with
          today’s dense urban core, illustrating how roads, bridges, and zoning changed the environment into structured
          commercial and residential zones.

          Bellevue Square also reflects changes in American culture: shopping shifted from a purely economic activity to a

          promoted a particular lifestyle of modern suburbia, family leisure, and seasonal events, connecting Bellevue to
          national patterns of consumer culture and suburban identity (Cross).

        <p>
          The project traces major developments and processes that shaped Bellevue’s transformation: Japanese American
          farming, wartime removal, the postwar housing boom, highway construction, and the tech-driven urbanization of the
          late 20th century. The interactive timeline and “From Fields to Skyline” before/after slider visualize these
          developments over time and help explain how national trends like the GI Bill and car culture reshaped local land use
          and everyday life (Humes).

          intended audience, and historical situation, and I explain how those factors shape the message. This sourcing and
          contextualization show how different groups from Japanese American farmers to postwar developers, told very
          different stories about the same land (Densho Encyclopedia; HistoryLink.org).

    <div class="grid-2 narrative-grid">
      <article class="card glass narrative-main">
        <p>
          In the early 1900s, Bellevue’s economy relied heavily on small farms, including Japanese American owned strawberry
          farms that supplied fruit to markets across the region (Snoqualmie Valley Historical Society). These farms created a
          rural community centered on land, labor, and family networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          During World War II, Executive Order 9066 forced Japanese American families off their land and into incarceration
          camps (Densho Encyclopedia). Their property was sold or taken over, clearing the way for new postwar development.
          This turning point shows how national wartime policy and racism directly altered local land ownership and opened
          space for future suburban projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the war, returning veterans used GI Bill benefits to buy homes, car ownership expanded, and new bridges and
          highways connected the Eastside to Seattle. In 1946, Bellevue Square opened as an auto oriented suburban shopping
          center, with large parking lots and modern department stores that reflected postwar consumer culture and the rise of
          the shopping mall as a “new downtown” (HistoryLink.org).
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the 1960s–1980s, Bellevue Square expanded and enclosed, mirroring national trends toward indoor malls. The
          site became a social space for families and teenagers as well as a retail hub. By the 1990s and 2000s, the tech boom
          and companies like Microsoft helped transform Bellevue into a dense “edge city” with office towers, luxury retail,
          and mixed-use developments surrounding the mall (Garreau).
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Bellevue Square functions as an “experience hub,” hosting events, dining, and lifestyle-focused spaces in
          addition to shopping. The website’s narrative shows how this single location reflects broader U.S. themes of
          suburbanization, economic development, cultural change, and the continuing debate over what community and public
          space look like in a postwar, car-centered, and increasingly digital society.

            <p>
              After World War II, rising incomes, GI Bill benefits, and mass car ownership pushed families out of city cores
              and into new suburbs (Humes). Highways and bridges made it normal to drive to work, school, and shopping.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bellevue Square’s design reflects that world: huge parking lots, wide access roads, and store entrances that
              face the lot instead of a traditional downtown street. The mall exists because everyday life was reorganized
              around the car (HistoryLink.org).

            <h3>02 · Japanese American Internment &amp; Land Ownership</h3>
            <p>
              Before WWII, Japanese American farmers grew strawberries and other crops across the Eastside and built tight
              community networks (SVHS; Densho). In 1942, Executive Order 9066 forced them into incarceration camps, and
              their land was sold or taken over (Daniels).
            </p>
            <p>
              These removals cleared the way for postwar developers. The land that once supported farming families became
              subdivisions and, eventually, the commercial land under and around Bellevue Square.

              Floating bridges and interstate highways connected the Eastside to Seattle and the broader Puget Sound region

              With better access, Bellevue became attractive for businesses and shoppers. Bellevue Square grew into a

            <h3>05 · Zoning, Density &amp; the “Urban Village”</h3>
            <p>
              City planners used zoning changes and development incentives to push more housing and offices into the
              downtown core. Instead of endless sprawl, Bellevue started building upward with mixed use towers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Around Bellevue Square, this meant new condos, hotels, and office towers directly attached to the mall, turning
              it into the center of an urban village rather than a stand-alone shopping center.

            <h3>06 · Online Shopping &amp; the Experience Economy</h3>
            <p>
              As online shopping grew in the 2000s–2010s, traditional malls risked losing customers who could buy almost
              anything from home. To stay relevant, many centers shifted toward experiences rather than just products.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bellevue Square responded by hosting seasonal events, pop-up installations, and interactive displays, turning
              in person visits into something that feels social and memorable instead of just transactional.

          This photograph shows rows of strawberry plants on a Japanese American operated farm on the Eastside. It illustrates
          how agriculture shaped Bellevue’s early economy and how much labor and land were invested before suburban development.
          In the project, it supports the claim that Bellevue’s “origin story” is rural and immigrant-based, not purely suburban.

          This removal notice ordered Japanese Americans to leave their homes and report for “relocation.” It demonstrates how
          federal wartime policy directly disrupted communities on the Eastside. In the narrative, it supports the argument that
          internment cleared land for later suburban and commercial redevelopment.

          explain how policy not just the free market guided where towers, housing, and retail could grow. It supports the claim
          that Bellevue’s transformation into an “urban village” around the mall was carefully planned rather than accidental.

              <h3>Actual Timeline: From Farms to Mall</h3>
              <p>
                In the real timeline, Japanese American farmers on the Eastside were removed under Executive Order 9066. Their
                land was sold or taken over, and after the war, developers used those parcels along with new infrastructure and
                zoning to build subdivisions and eventually Bellevue Square and its surrounding retail core (Densho;
                HistoryLink.org).
              </p>
              <p>
                Bellevue became a classic postwar suburb and then an “edge city,” with the mall and nearby office towers
                symbolizing prosperity, consumption, and high tech growth.

              <h3>Alternate Timeline: Farming City with a Different Center</h3>
              <p>
                In an alternate version of history, Japanese American families return from the war and reclaim or keep their land.
                Instead of being converted quickly into suburban tracts, large portions of the Eastside remain in small scale
                agriculture and family run food businesses.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bellevue might still develop a commercial center, but it could revolve around a public market, farm co-ops, and
                agricultural festivals rather than a car-oriented enclosed mall. The skyline might be lower, and local food
                economies and cultural traditions would stay more visible in the built environment.

              <p>
                Counterfactuals are not about pretending we can rewrite the past; they help reveal how much of the present is the
                result of specific choices and power structures. Imagining a Bellevue where Japanese American farmers kept their
                land makes it easier to see what was lost—not just property, but community networks, traditions, and alternative
                futures for the city’s development.
              </p>
              <p>
                This reflection connects back to the project’s main question: Bellevue Square’s story is not just about one mall.
                It is about whose stories became central, whose were pushed aside, and how geography, race, and policy interacted
                to shape the Eastside we see today.
